**Project Title: Remote Sensing Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks**

**Project Description:**
Remote sensing images play a crucial role in various applications such as agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. Automatic interpretation of these images is essential for extracting useful information and making informed decisions. In this project, we aim to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying remote sensing images into different categories.

The dataset used in this project is the RSI-CB256 dataset, which contains satellite images from different sensors and Google Maps snapshots. It consists of four classes, each representing a different type of land cover or land use.

We preprocess the dataset by resizing the images to a uniform size and augmenting them with rotation, shifting, and flipping to improve the model's generalization ability. We then split the dataset into training and validation sets, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for validation.

The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional and max-pooling layers followed by a fully connected layer. The output layer has four neurons, each representing one of the four classes in the dataset.

We compile the model using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function. The model is trained for 20 epochs using the training data and evaluated on the validation set.

**Results:**
After training the model, we achieve a final validation accuracy of 91.57%. The model performs well in classifying remote sensing images into the four different classes, demonstrating its effectiveness in automatic image interpretation.

**Future Work:**
In the future, we plan to further improve the model's performance by experimenting with different architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we aim to explore the use of transfer learning and ensemble methods to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.

Overall, this project highlights the potential of CNNs in classifying remote sensing images and demonstrates their importance in various remote sensing applications.
